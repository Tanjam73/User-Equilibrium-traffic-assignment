# 🚦 Sioux Falls User Equilibrium Solver (Julia)

Implemented a full User Equilibrium traffic assignment for the Sioux Falls network using the **Frank–Wolfe algorithm** with a **Dijkstra-based All-or-Nothing (AON)** shortest path assignment.

---

## Code Overview
- **`network.jl`** — loads the TNTP-format network and OD matrix, builds node and link structures.  
- **`dijk_aon.jl`** — computes shortest paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm with a priority queue and performs AON assignment to distribute OD flows.  
- **`frank_wolfe.jl`** — iteratively updates link flows and costs via the Frank–Wolfe method with precise line search and convergence tracking.  
- **`run_ue.jl`** — integrates everything: loads data, runs the solver, exports link flows (`ue_results.csv`), and plots convergence.
